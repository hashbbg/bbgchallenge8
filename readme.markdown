# BBGChallenge8

[#bbg](http://hashbbg.com) is having its either monthly game creation challenge!  During the next month, entrants will be creating a game around the theme/name chosen by [videogamena.me](http://videogamena.me/).  Each entrant has a maximum of 12 hours to create code, art and music towards their game.

If you have an itch to work with friends, then feel free to team up and submit a team entry.  Every member has 12 hours, and the size of your team has to be disclosed with your submission.

If you really want to, you can make as many games as you like; so long as you obey the time-limit per game. 

Entry's repos will be merged with this one, too, so feel free to have a look at anyone's source code after the fact.  

#### Dates!

The challenge starts on 15th July, 5pm GMT, and finishes 15th August, 5pm GMT.

#### Theme:

The theme for the contest is:

***Summer***

***Mushroom***

***Crisis***

Picked randomly using [videogamena.me](http://videogamena.me/).

## Rules

#### Submission

Fork this repo, create a folder for your entry, then pull request us when you're done.

#### Content restriction

* Use only content you have a legal right to.
* There's no problem with serious topics, but any explicit content should give the viewer some warning.  Any game with more serious content than [PG13](http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/what-each-rating-means) must show an up-front warning. 

#### Time restriction

Make sure you mark on your submission (preferably somewhere in the README or in the game itself) the number of hours spent to create it. 

You have to do all of the actual coding, music making and art making on the game itself within the 12 hours.  Feel free to do research/conceptual stuff outside that, like:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music

#### Libs/tools

Use any lib or tool you like.  It's all fair game ;)

#### Platform

It has to run in a browser! Feel free to specify *which* browser, but remember; if you're too specific, fewer people may end up playing it.
