                    <a href="http://hashbbg.com">#bbg</a> is having its monthly game creation challenge!
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the next month, entrants will be creating a game around the theme/name chosen by <a href="http://videogamena.me/">videogamena.me</a>.  Each entrant has a maximum of 12 hours to create code, art and music towards their game.
                    If you have an itch to work with friends, then feel free to team up and submit a team entry.  Every member has 12 hours, and the size of your team has to be disclosed with your submission.
                    If you really want to, you can make as many games as you like; so long as you obey the time-limit per game.
                    Entry's repos will be merged with this one, too, so feel free to have a look at anyone's source code after the fact.
                </p>

                <li>There's no problem with serious topics, but any explicit content should give the viewer some warning.  Any game with more serious content than <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/what-each-rating-means">PG13</a> must show an up-front warning. </li>

                <p>Make sure you mark on your submission (preferably somewhere in the README or in the game itself) the number of hours spent to create it. </p>
                <p>You have to do all of the actual coding, music making and art making on the game itself within the 12 hours.  Feel free to do research/conceptual stuff outside that, like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thinking/conceptualising</li>
                    <li>Drafting game design</li>
                    <li>Looking for tools/art/music</li>
